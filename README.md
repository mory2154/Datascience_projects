## Project 1:Titanic Survival Exploration with Decision Trees
 Titanic survival data Explore by implementing a decision tree in sci-kit-learn

 ## Project 2: Classification Models Evaluations
 The aim of this workbook is to provide practice with metrics specifically related to classification problems.
To this end, we will use the spam dataset.

 ## Project 3: Regression Models Evaluations
 The aim of this workbook is to provide practice with metrics specifically related to regression problems.
To this end, we will use the Boston Housing dataset.

## Project 4: Improving a model with Grid Search
In this mini-lab, we'll fit a decision tree model to some sample data. This initial model will overfit heavily. Then we'll use Grid Search to find better parameters for this model, to reduce the overfitting.

## Project 5: Diabetes Case Study
In this mini-lab, we'll try to optimize a number of models using Randomized Grid Searching in this  notebook.
